**Technical** **Charter (the “Charter”)**

**for**

**Open Programmable Infrastructure Project a Series of LF Projects, LLC**

**Adopted June 9, 2022**

  


This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the Open Programmable Infrastructure Project, also known as the OPI Project, an open source project which has been established as Open Programmable Infrastructure Project  a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”).  LF Projects, LLC (“LF Projects”) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, “Collaborators”) must comply with the terms of this Charter. 

1. **Mission and Scope of the Project**

   1. The mission of the Project is to develop a community-driven standards-based open ecosystem for next generation architectures and frameworks based on DPU/IPU-like technologies.
   2. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.


2. **Technical Steering Committee**

   1. The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project. 

   2. At the inception of the Project and for one year thereafter (the “Startup Period”), the TSC will be made up of:

      1. one representative appointed by each Premier Member of the Open Programmable Infrastructure Fund (the “Directed Fund”) of the Linux Foundation; and
      2. one maintainer, selected by the Governing Board of the Directed Fund, from each sub-project of the Technical Project (each such sub-project, a “Sub-project”).

   3. Following the Startup Period, the TSC will be made up of: 

      1. two maintainers from each Sub-project (to be selected by each Sub-project); and
      2. two technical contributors (the “Technical Contributors”) appointed by the TSC.

   4. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file.  It is expected that the makeup of the TSC will gradually transition to a model of elected Sub-project technical leadership, starting in the second year of the Project. This transition will be determined by the TSC.

   5. Members of the TSC must be active contributors (the meaning of an “active contributor” will be determined by the TSC) to be nominated or appointed to be on the TSC.

   6. With the exception of discussion of sensitive topics such as security vulnerabilities, meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person. 

   7. TSC Sub-projects generally will involve Contributors and Maintainers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented: 

      1. Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, other technical artifacts, or their time and resources to the Project; 
      2. Maintainers are Contributors who have earned root-level approval on changes to each Sub-project’s core repositories, and taken on responsibility for the Sub-project as a whole;


3. A Contributor may become a Maintainer by a majority approval of the existing Maintainers. A Maintainer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Maintainers.


8. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Maintainer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter. 

9. The TSC may (1) establish workflow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of Sub-projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Maintainer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Maintainers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

10. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC.  The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so designated by the TSC, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project and the Directed Fund.  Unless otherwise decided by the TSC, the TSC Chair will be elected to a two-year term.

11. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

    1. coordinating the technical direction of the Project;
    2. approving Sub-project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a Sub-project’s scope);
    3. organizing, designating and removing Sub-projects;
    4. determining election or selection processes for determination of the Technical Contributors;
    5. creating committees or working groups, including a Code of Conduct Committee;
    6. appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;
    7. establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;
    8. approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the “Series Manager”) to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter;
    9. discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple Sub-projects; and
    10. coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project.


3. **TSC Voting**

   1. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.
   2. Following the Startup Period, if more than 40% of the TSC members are employed by the same organization or by related organizations (such TSC members, “Related Company TSC Members”), then the vote of all Related Company TSC Members, as a group, will be limited to 40% of the eligible votes. 
   3. Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least 60% percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.
   4. Except as provided in Section 7.c. and 8.a, decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all voting members of the TSC.
   5. In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, any voting member of the TSC may refer the matter to the Series Manager for assistance in reaching a resolution.

4. **Compliance with Policies**

   1. This Charter is subject to the [Series Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rDq5luH_9cSgD_8wY0IOyyhLvzbddGBiwBoK2XY5OvA/edit) for the Project and the Operating Agreement of LF Projects. Contributors will comply with the policies of LF Projects as may be adopted and amended by LF Projects, including, without limitation the policies listed at https&#x3A;//lfprojects.org/policies/.  
   2. The TSC may adopt a code of conduct (“CoC”) for the Project, which is subject to approval by the Series Manager.  In the event that a Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Projects Code of Conduct listed at <https://lfprojects.org/policies> will apply for all Collaborators in the Project.
   3. When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project, LF Projects will publish such policy, as to be amended or adopted, on its web site at least 30 days prior to such policy taking effect; provided, however, that in the case of any amendment of the Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of LF Projects, any such amendment is effective upon publication on LF Project’s web site.
   4. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests.

   5. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and easily visible to all. Any potential violations of this requirement should be reported immediately to the Series Manager.
